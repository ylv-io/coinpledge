# Why to Use?  

Humans are funny creations. We care so much about the opinion of other people, that it dramatically improves our chances to succeed at something if we make it public. [Loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) means people would rather not lose $5 than gain $5. By staking ether on your goal, you force loss aversion to work for you. Coinpledge uses both principles to improve your chances to succeed at your goal.

# Is My Ether Safe?  

Coinpledge is Ethereum dApp. Your ether is managed by a [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x896f11b2628208e09bd5cfdd0c4f7c28c0349d61#code) and we do not have access to your funds.

# How to Use?  

Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), get some ether, [pick a username](https://coinpledge.ylv.io/account) and start a [new challenge](https://coinpledge.ylv.io/new).

# How Much Does It Cost?  

It is free! However, we do take a 10% cut from mentor reward, so if you want to use CoinPledge absolutely for free, make sure to set mentor reward to 0.

# What Happens to My Stake If I Lose?  

Your staked ether goes to your personal bonus fund. Everytime you win a challenge, you get 50% as bonus from your bonus fund. If it is less than 1 [finney](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/253/the-ether-denominations-are-called-finney-szabo-and-wei-what-who-are-these-na), you get it all back.

# I Need All My Ether Back Immediately!  

Sorry, we can't help. It is a smart contract. No one controls it. You can create many fake challenges and quickly resolve them using another account. That will bring all you ether back to you, but shame will live forever on the blockchain. Ha-ha!
